I'm a Master's student in the Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institution (TBSI) at Tsinghua University, fortunately advised by Wenbo Ding. I previously interned at the Bing News & Feeds Group in Microsoft, the Social Computing Group in MSR Asia, and the Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR) in Tsinghua University.
